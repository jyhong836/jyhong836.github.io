## About

Thanks for dropping by. I hope that it will not waste your time, but in case it does, at least I tried.
Originally at the fall of 2011, I started my adventures in science at USTC where I received my Bachelor in Optics and Optical Engineering. Now I am studying for a master of Computer Science on Intelligent Computing and Application. I love the phrase, *Less is More*.
