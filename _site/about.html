## About

Hi, I'm Junyuan Hong, a developer and researcher. As a Computer Science master student, my adventures began when I was still a undergraduate in Optics and Optical Engineering, USTC.  Since fist program-language course of *C* in 2011, programing occupies amount of my free time. Impressed by the spirit of Open-Source community, I started my exploration at GitHub, struggling to become an open-source developer. And as a physics student, the power of computer science in science computation astonished me indeed. Further attracted by the effects of Artificial Intelligence(AI) in daily life, I choose to research into Machine Learning, a relevant field to AI, at USTC-Birmingham Joint Research Institute(UBRI) in 2014. Now I'm seeking for a chance to be PhD student in fields, like manifold learning, neural network and their application.

The phrase showed at the begining of the site, *Less is More*, is the idea I'm keen on, which reminds me to keep things brief but clear everyday.
